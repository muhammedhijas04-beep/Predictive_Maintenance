Manufacturing Operations Analytics – Power BI Project

A complete end-to-end analytics solution for manufacturing operations, covering Production, Machine Efficiency, Scheduling & Delay, Energy Usage, Material Consumption, and Failure Analysis.

This project replicates what modern factories use for Operational Excellence (OPEX), TPM, Lean Manufacturing, Predictive Insights, and Cost Optimization.

Key Highlights

✔ 8 fully interactive dashboards
✔ 30+ KPIs across performance, scheduling, efficiency, failures, energy & material
✔ Insight automation (NLP-based dynamic summaries)
✔ Clean, industry-ready UI
✔ DAX-driven calculations with time intelligence & optimization metrics
✔ Designed as a full factory analytics system
